- Dynamic feature showcase with live code snippets
- Pricing plans with a highlighted "most popular" option
- Customer testimonials grid
- FAQ accordion
- Contact form for lead capture

### ✨ Advanced features

- **Dark / Light mode toggle** – switch themes from the navbar, preference stored in localStorage
- Lazy‑loaded sections using React.lazy & Suspense for faster initial load
- Throttled interactive effects (animation follows cursor with requestAnimationFrame)
- `loading="lazy"` on testimonial images to defer offscreen assets
- Animated scroll‑to‑top button appearing after scrolling
- Responsive mobile menu with navigation links and theme switch
- Simple state‑managed contact form (mock submission)
